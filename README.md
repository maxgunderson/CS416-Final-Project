# CS416-Final-Project

Final project for CSCI 416 - Intro to Machine Learning

I used the Boston housing data set to train a linear regression model with stochastic gradient descent (and different learning rates and regularization) 
to predict housing prices. Then, to compare the performance against more complex models that might be able to capture non-linear trends in the data, I 
trained an AdaBoost regressor and neural network to compare performance.
